# Projectile Movement

A project that simulates the creation and movement of a ball, when thrown with a random direction and velocity, following a projectile motion.

## Theorycraft

The values used where selected to be as close as reality as possible. The gravity value used was 9.81 ms2, which will weigh on the Y axis, pulling the ball down.
The velocity on the X axis is constant, except for when it hits a wall, in which case it slows it by 10%. 

## Setup

`git clone https://github.com/LuisLeandro94/projectile-movement.git`

`cd .\projectile-movement\`

`npm install`

## Compile
